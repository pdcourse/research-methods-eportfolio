<p>Overall, I was reasonably satisfied with my performance on both the Literature Review and Research Proposal, though the feedback highlighted several areas for growth. While there was evidence of good knowledge and understanding, I now recognise that I relied too heavily on background familiarity with the topic rather than consistently grounding my work in theoretical frameworks. For future assignments, I will prioritise integrating more academic theory to strengthen both critical analysis and contextual depth.</p>

<p>Completing the Literature Review early on helped me identify key sources and shape my research direction, but the final proposal would have benefitted from a more rigorous and comprehensive use of supporting literature. I also realised that while the structure of my PowerPoint was clear, the presentation could have had more impact with stronger visual elements and richer reference material. These are aspects I intend to focus on in upcoming work, particularly in terms of improving clarity and depth in both written and visual communication.</p>

<p>The feedback also pointed out a tendency to talk around the subject rather than engage directly with core theoretical debates. This has encouraged me to take a more focused and analytical approach in future work, especially when justifying methodological choices.</p>
