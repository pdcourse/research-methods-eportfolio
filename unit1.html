        <h2>Unit 1</h2>
        
        <p>This unit focused on the ethical, legal, social, and professional responsibilities of computing professionals. I participated in collaborative forum discussions and independent reading to explore challenges at the intersection of technology and ethics. The main learning outcomes addressed include recognising ethical issues in computing practice and evaluating professional codes of conduct.</p>

<p>In my initial discussion post (can be found <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=295490">here</a>), I examined the topic of deceptive interface design, also known as dark UX patterns. Drawing on research by Gray et al. (2018), Mathur et al. (2019), and recent findings by the Federal Trade Commission (2022), I analysed how common these manipulative tactics have become and how they erode user trust. The case studies and real-world examples underscored how short-term business gains are often prioritised at the expense of user autonomy and accessibility, particularly for vulnerable user groups. I contextualised these practices using ethical frameworks such as the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (2022), identifying violations of principles related to user wellbeing, integrity, and public interest.</p>

<p>I also engaged with academic readings on AI governance, including Correa et al. (2023), Deckard (2023), and related sources like Fjeld et al. (2020) and Finn and Shilton (2023). These texts explored how different nations and organisations are approaching the regulation of generative AI, highlighting the complexity of developing globally accepted ethical guidelines. These readings helped me reflect critically on the ethical and professional responsibilities of AI practitioners in the face of evolving technologies and governance challenges.</p>

<p>Although I did not complete the formative 1,000-word reflective piece, I fully engaged with the readings and discussions. This unit strengthened my understanding of professional conduct in the tech industry and helped me build key skills such as critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and reflective analysis—laying a strong foundation for further study and professional development.</p>
