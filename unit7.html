        <h2>Unit 7</h2>
        <p>This section expanded my grasp of hypothesis testing by applying statistical methods in Excel, focusing on both paired and independent t-tests. I explored how to evaluate differences between related conditions and separate groups through real-world examples.</p>

<p>For instance, in a paired t-test comparing two container designs (Example 7.1), the analysis revealed a significant mean difference of 13.2 items sold (p = 0.018), pointing to the impact of design. The independent samples test on diet effectiveness (Example 7.2) showed a 1.63 kg advantage for Diet A (p = 0.0028), emphasising the importance of testing assumptions like normal distribution and equal variance.</p>

<p>Many of the statistical ideas revisited here—such as defining hypotheses, working with significance levels, and analysing output—were introduced in last year’s Numerical Analysis course. This unit pushed me to apply them with greater depth and precision in a practical context.</p>

<p>Through these exercises, I improved my ability to clearly state null and alternative hypotheses, use Excel's built-in tools for t-tests, interpret statistical outputs, and decide between one- and two-tailed tests based on the research question.</p>

<p>These methods will be directly relevant future work such as my capstone project, especially when testing model predictions or comparing results from different system configurations. I also plan to incorporate more thorough checks of assumptions, such as visual assessments of distribution shapes.</p>

<p>The second worksheet focused on summarising data through descriptive statistics in Excel, using both numerical and categorical examples. I worked with weight loss data to explore averages and variability, and analysed brand preference by region using frequency counts.</p>

<p>In the case of Diet A, the mean weight loss was 5.341 kg with a standard deviation of 2.536 kg, supported by a median of 5.642 kg and an interquartile range of 3.285 kg. This suggested relatively consistent results compared to Diet B, which showed greater variation and lower average loss.</p>

<p>For categorical data, I used functions like <code>COUNTIF</code> and percentage formulas to examine brand preference across two areas. This demonstrated how summarising data as frequencies and proportions makes it much easier to interpret than reviewing raw figures alone.</p>
